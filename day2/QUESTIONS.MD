> 2. What is the subnet of the canister with the id: mwrha-maaaa-aaaab-qabqq-cai? How much nodes are running this subnet?
Answer:
    The Subnet is: pae4o-o6dxf-xki7q-ezclx-znyd6-fnk6w-vkv5z-5lfwh-xym2i-otrrw-fqe

> 3. i have a neuron with 1O ICPs locked with a dissolve delay of 4 years - my neuron has been locked for 2 years. What is my expected voting power?

     The voting power of a locked neuron is determined by several factors:

    1) Principally, by its stake. 1 ICP = the power of 1 vote.
    2) Next, by its lock up duration, or dissolve delay. 6 months grants a 1.06x voting power bonus, and 8 years grants 2x. All other durations scale linearly between.
    3) Lastly, by its age, or length of time spent locked up without dissolving. 4 years grants a 1.25x bonus, multiplicative with any other bonuses. All other durations between 0 seconds and 4 years scale linearly between.

So base on this our equation shall be: "10 * 1.498 * 1.125 = 16,8525"

So your voting power is 16,8525

> 4. What is wrong with the following code?

    actor {
     let n : Nat = 50;
     let t : Text = "Hello";

    public func convert_to_text(m : Nat) : async Text {
    Nat.toText(m);
    };
 
    }

Answer:
    The toText() function is being used tho it was not declared for its use, import Nat "mo:base/Nat" would be missing

> 5. What is wrong with the following code?

    actor {
    var languages : [var Text] = ["English", "German", "Chinese", "Japanese", "French"];

    public func show_languages(language : Text) : async [var Text] {
    return (languages);
    };
    }

Answer:
    The public function should not return a mutable array so we have to change the languages array to immutable the languages array before returning it and remove the var keyword from the return type

> 6.What is wrong with the following code?
    actor {
    var languages : [Text] = ["English", "German", "Chinese", "Japanese", "French"];

    public func add_language(new_language: Text) : async [Text] {
    languages := Array.append<Text>(languages, [new_language]);
    return (languages);
    };
    }

Answer:
    importing the array library is mandatory, import Array "mo:base/Array", has to be used in the function, also the append function is deprecated so we use a Buffer instead of an Array for that reason.
