> 3. i have a neuron with 1O ICPs locked with a dissolve delay of 4 years - my neuron has been locked for 2 years. What is my expected voting power?

     The voting power of a locked neuron is determined by several factors:

    1) Principally, by its stake. 1 ICP = the power of 1 vote.
    2) Next, by its lock up duration, or dissolve delay. 6 months grants a 1.06x voting power bonus, and 8 years grants 2x. All other durations scale linearly between.
    3) Lastly, by its age, or length of time spent locked up without dissolving. 4 years grants a 1.25x bonus, multiplicative with any other bonuses. All other durations between 0 seconds and 4 years scale linearly between.

So base on this our equation shall be: "10 * 1.498 * 1.125 = 16,8525"

So your voting power is 16,8525
